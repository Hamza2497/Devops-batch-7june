Jenkins Demo:

Connect to the Devops Updated Lab

Open the browser on the lab

in the URL give : http://localhost:8080

The crednetials to log into Jenkins are:

username: admin
password: admin





1. Create a Freestyle job in jenkins

2. Create a freestyle job and integrate it with GITHUB repostitory

Demo 1: Create a Jenkisn job that will clone a github repository in jenkins workspace

Create a new job in jenkins
Click on + sign to create new item/job/project
Give a name to the job : CloneRepo
Select freestyle project and click on OK button
On the project click on Source code management
Select git option
Give git hub repo path
https://github.com/Sonal0409/myproject05Aug

Branch name as ===>  Master

Save the job

Click on Build now

Repository will be cloned in jenkins workspace

You can go to job â†’ workspace folder to see the files

=======================

Demo 2: Jenkins + maven integration:

Jenkins--> Manage Jenkins-->Global Tool configuration

Under GIT==> leave it same 

Under maven ==> lets install it automatically
Type mymaven and check the install automatically box.
Save the changes


**********************************
Job Package Job
***************************

Go to jenkins--> new item--> Name= Package==> freestyle project
==> source codemanagement==>select git==> give git repo name https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsClassCodes
 
build ==> invoke top level maven target==>mymaven

 goal = clean install package

==> save==> build now
==> click on build number and see the console

==> go to workspace ==> target/addressbook.war

==========================================================================


pipelines Using plugins are called as Plugin based pipelines or Upstream and downstream pipelines
These pipelines are created using freestyle jobs.

Jenkins allows us to create multiple task in one single job.

Whenever a user has to perfom set of tasks one after other (in a sequence) or in parallel, it can easily be done using 
pipleine template in jenkins

Pipleines in jenkins are nothing but set of task executed in sequence(by default) 

When a user is creating a pipeline we will have to write code for it.
The pipeline code is based on Groovy scripting which is Domain specific lanaguage
In jenkins pipeline code using 2 types of syntax

 > scripted pipeline syntax
=======================================
> scripted pipeline syntax always starts with a keyword called as node
> When Jenkins version1 came in to the market, the admin used scripted pipeline syntax to write pipeline code
> scripted pipeline syntax is difficult to read and write.
> there is no structure or no definite style which writitng the code
> The code written scripted pipeline syntax is not validated by jenkins
> This syntax is no longer used
> if the pipeline fails, you have to run the pipeline from the begining

 > Declarative pipeline syntax
========================================
> Declarative pipeline syntax always starts with a keyword called as pipeline
> With jenkins version2, Declarative pipeline syntax was introduced
> This is well structured syntax, where user is provided with definite pipeline sections
> we need to just declare the pipeline code
> It declarative in nature, syntax is very simple
> if the pipeline failes, you can restart the pipeline form the point that it had failed previously
> Stages in pipeline means Job to be executed
> Every stage will have a Name in the pipeline, steps to be executed, post build steps, 
> jenkins provides a pipeline code snippet generator, that helps your to learn pipeline scripting very fast

Syntax:  key 'value' 
for example: name 'Jenkins'
             sh 'echo "hello All"'

Structure of Declarative pipeline syntax

=========================================

pipeline{

  tools{
		// declare names of tools that will while executing pipeline tasks
}

parameters{

}
agent {
// this is mandatory
// which server the pipleline will be executed
}

stages{
  stage('job1'){
	steps{
		//clone a repo
       }
}
stage('job2'){
	steps{
		sh 'mkdir myfiles'
 		sh 'cd myfiles'
        sh 'mvn compile'
       }
}
stage('job3'){
	steps{
		//clone a repo
       }
}

}

}

Demo  on pipeline code

==============================


pipeline{
    
    tools{
        maven 'mymaven'
    }
   // in agent any = any available server 
    agent any
   stages{
       stage('Clone a Repo'){
           steps{
               git 'https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsCodeDemo.git'
           }
       }
       
       stage('Compile the code'){
           steps{
               sh 'mvn compile'
           }
       }
       
       stage('Unit Test'){
           steps{
               sh 'mvn test'
           }
       }
       
       stage('Package'){
           steps{
               sh 'mvn package'
           }
       }
       }
}
