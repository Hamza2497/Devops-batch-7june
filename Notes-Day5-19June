Check Ansible Installation:
*****************************
$ ansible --version

Ad Hoc Commands in Ansible
==========================

 These are ansible direct commands.
When we have a single module to be executed on host servers, we use adhoc commands
Whenever we want to quickly check a result or a file or a change on the host servers, we can use adhoc command.
When we have multiple modules to be executed, we cannot use adhoc command
It is just a single command which cannot be reused.

Syntax:

# ansible host -m modulename -a “argument”


Ping module: trivial module, used with adhoc commands
==========
Check ⇒ if ansible is able connect with host and it will check python configuration on all hosts

# ansible localhost -m ping

Command module:
# ansible localhost -m command -a  "uptime"

# ansible localhost -m command -a “df -h”


Introduction to YAML:
===========================

Ansible playbook are written in YAML

YAML is not a programming language, scripting language

It is a fileformat used to save data like json or XML

YAML files save data in form of key and value

It is declarative in nature

The extension of YAML file is .yml or .YAML

YAML syntax

key: value

key: name of the key is given by the tool
value: will be given by the user

Write YAML synatx which store single value:

==============================================

Playbook to deploy an HTML code on Apache webserver
=========================================

# sudo su -

# cd /etc/ansible

First create a index.html file in the directory /etc/ansible

$ vim index.html
 Write any text and save the file

<h1> this file is from ansible </h1>
<h1> created by </h1>

Save the file

Continue the scenario and create a playbook:
===========================
$ pwd   ⇒ /etc/ansible

vim playbook1.yml

The complete playbook is:

- hosts: localhost
  become: true
  tasks:
  - name: update repo
    command: apt update -y
  - name: Install a package apache2
    apt: name=apache2 state=present
  - name: Start apache2 service
    service: name=apache2 state=started
  - name: Deploy index.html file
    copy: src=index.html dest=/var/www/html
  - name: restart apache2 server
    service: name=apache2 state=restarted


Execute the playbook

# ansible-playbook playbook1.yml

Go to browser of lab and give

localhost:80

==================================


===========================================================
Terraform:
========================================================

Setup Terraform:

Execute below command to install terraform:

wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform


OR

wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.8.5/terraform_1.8.5_linux_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_1.8.5_linux_amd64.zip
mv terraform /usr/local/bin
execute these commands on the lab terminal
close the terminal
and open again
terraform --version


Verify:
$ terraform --version



=========================================================

User creation in AWS and create accesskey and secret key for it.

We will use this accesskey and secret key in the terraform configuration file.


You will be connected to AWS management:

In the search box, give IAM and select it.
You will be on IAM dashboard

On the left side→ click on Users→ Click on ADD user button →unser user details give User name as Terraform → click on next →select 3rd option Attach policies directly →scroll down and from list click on AdministratorAccess →Scroll down → click next → scroll down and click on Create User.

Click on the user name Terraform →Click on security credentials tab→ scroll down to access key→ click on create access key→Click on Command Line Interface (CLI) → Scroll down→Select the box of→ I understand the above recommendation and want to proceed to create an access key. → click on next → click on create access key

Copy the access key : 
Coppy and secret key: 

=========================================================



Demo 1:
===============================
             Connect and authenticate terraform with the AWS provider.
===============================
Terraform code is always written in block format
The first block that you will see in main terraform file is provider block

This block consist of following information:

> name of the provider
> region where we want to create infrastructure
> access key and secret key to connect AWS securely

For this create a directory on the lab:

# mkdir myterraformfiles
# cd myterraformfiles
# vim awsinstance.tf

provider "aws" {

  region     = "us-east-1"

  access_key = "sgfdfgdgdg"

  secret_key = "54354rdfdgdfgdgfdff"

}


Note: replace access key and secret key with your values.

Save the file and execute below command:

# terraform init

Registry link : https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs


Demo2:
==========================================================
Create an ec2 instance in AWS using terraform:
The full code of terraform with provider and resource:
================================================

provider "aws" {

  region     = "us-east-1"

  access_key = "AKIAUJU24ZR3XTD4A6PC"

  secret_key = "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"

}

resource "aws_instance" "myec2" {

  ami           = "ami-03c7d01cf4dedc891"

  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {

    Name = "terrafrom-instance"

  }

}

Execute below commands

# terraform validate

# terraform plan

# terraform apply

# terraform destroy
