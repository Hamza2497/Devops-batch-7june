Check Ansible Installation:
*****************************
$ ansible --version

Ad Hoc Commands in Ansible
==========================

 These are ansible direct commands.
When we have a single module to be executed on host servers, we use adhoc commands
Whenever we want to quickly check a result or a file or a change on the host servers, we can use adhoc command.
When we have multiple modules to be executed, we cannot use adhoc command
It is just a single command which cannot be reused.

Syntax:

# ansible host -m modulename -a “argument”


Ping module: trivial module, used with adhoc commands
==========
Check ⇒ if ansible is able connect with host and it will check python configuration on all hosts

# ansible localhost -m ping

Command module:
# ansible localhost -m command -a  "uptime"

# ansible localhost -m command -a “df -h”


Introduction to YAML:
===========================

Ansible playbook are written in YAML

YAML is not a programming language, scripting language

It is a fileformat used to save data like json or XML

YAML files save data in form of key and value

It is declarative in nature

The extension of YAML file is .yml or .YAML

YAML syntax

key: value

key: name of the key is given by the tool
value: will be given by the user

First create a index.html file in the directory /etc/ansible

$ vim index.html
 Write any text and save the file

<h1> this file is from ansible </h1>

Continue the scenario and create a playbook:
===========================
$ pwd   ⇒ /etc/ansible

vim playbook1.yml

The complete playbook is:

- hosts: localhost
  become: true
  tasks:
  - name: update repo
    command: apt update -y
  - name: Install a package apache2
    apt: name=apache2 state=present
  - name: Start apache2 service
    service: name=apache2 state=started
  - name: Deploy index.html file
    copy: src=index.html dest=/var/www/html
  - name: restart apache2 server
    service: name=apache2 state=restarted


Execute the playbook

# ansible-playbook playbook1.yml

Go to browser of lab and give

localhost:80
