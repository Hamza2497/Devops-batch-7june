Terraform:
========================================================

Setup Terraform:


wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.8.5/terraform_1.8.5_linux_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_1.8.5_linux_amd64.zip
mv terraform /usr/local/bin
execute these commands on the lab terminal
close the terminal
and open again
terraform --version


Verify:
$ terraform --version



=========================================================
User creation in AWS and create accesskey and secret key for it.

We will use this accesskey and secret key in the terraform configuration file.


You will be connected to AWS management:

In the search box, give IAM and select it.
You will be on IAM dashboard

On the left side→ click on Users→ Click on ADD user button →under user details give User name as Terraform → click on next →select 3rd option Attach policies directly →scroll down and from list click on AdministratorAccess →Scroll down → click next → scroll down and click on Create User.

Click on the user name Terraform →Click on security credentials tab→ scroll down to access key→ click on create access key→Click on Command Line Interface (CLI) → Scroll down→Select the box of→ I understand the above recommendation and want to proceed to create an access key. → click on next → click on create access key

Copy the access key : AKIAUJU24ZR376EQHPJQ
Coppy and secret key: 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

=================================

Demo 1:
===============================
             Connect and authenticate terraform with the AWS provider.
===============================
Terraform code is always written in block format
The first block that you will see in main terraform file is provider block

This block consist of following information:

> name of the provider
> region where we want to create infrastructure
> access key and secret key to connect AWS securely

For this create a directory on the lab:

# mkdir myterraformfiles
# cd myterraformfiles
# vim awsinfra.tf

provider "aws" {

  region     = "us-east-1"

  access_key = "give_your_access_key"

  secret_key = "give_your_secretkey"

}

resource "aws_instance" "myec2" {

ami = "ami-0eaf7c3456e7b5b68"

instance_type = "t2.micro"

tags = {

    Name = "instance-1"

  }

}


Save the file



Note: replace access key and secret key with your values.

Save the file and execute below command:

# terraform init  

# terraform validate

# terraform plan

# terraform apply --auto-approve

It will ask for approval 

Give:  yes


# terraform destroy --auto-approve






Docker:
********************************************
Lab already has docker installed

$ sudo su -
$ docker --version

Start the docker engine

$ systemctl start docker

$ systemctl status docker

Docker Images:
*************************

Demo1: Pull Image from docker hub to your local docker host

docker pull imagename

$ docker pull ubuntu

Docker will pull the image with tag as latest from docker hub library

OR

docker pull imagename:tagname

$ docker pull ubuntu:20.04

Will pull ubuntu image of tag 20.04

2. Check the list of  images pulled from docker host

$ docker images

OR

$ docker image ls

3. Search for images:
**************
$ docker search hello-world

4. Delete the images from local docker host
*******************
$ docker rmi ubuntu

$ docker rmi ubuntu:20.04

5. Run an Image to create a container
****************

Docker run Imagename


$ docker run ubuntu

Run command: will first check locally if image ubuntu is available or not

If image is not available locally

RUn command will automatically

> pull image from docker hub
> run the image to launch a container
> user will be inside the container process
> user will not be able to see the host machine cursor


6. See the list of container created

$ docker ps -a


7.  Launch a container from an Image and container should be up & running

When we execute the run command we have to mention in which mode we want to launch the container

Foreground mode

$ docker run -it imagename

-i : interactive
-t: terminal

$ docker run -it ubuntu

Container will be launched
Will be up & running
User will be attached to the container
That is , user will be on the container terminal

Whenever you are attached to the terminal of the container, using the following options you will come out of the container:

Ctl pq

User will come out of the container and container will be still up and running

exit

User will come out of the container and container will be exited

Attach to the terminal of the container again:

$ docker attach containerid/containername

Execute exit command to comout of container

User will come out of the container and container will be exited

To start a exited container:

$ docker start containerid/name

To stop a running container

$ docker stop containerid/name

Detached mode (-d)
====================================================

$ docker run -d nginx
$ docker ps -a
$ docker container ls – list containers in running status

Container will be launched
Will be up & running
User will be detached to the container ie: container is running in the background, user can continue working on the host machine

Delete a Container from the host machine

$ docker rm -f containername/conatinerid
$ docker rm -f n1
$ docker ps -a : no container will be there


Describe all Details of the container created
****************

Inspect is the command that will describe all the details of the container in json format

$ docker inspect containername/id

Port mapping or port forwarding
*****************
By default docker container is ready to be accessed by the user, it is the user internet who cannot reach the container.
Port mapping/port forwarding is  a concept in docker that allows a user to access the container from browser of his machine
Port mapping has to be done at the run time of container
If the container is already running/exited, you cannot do port forwarding
In port forwarding we have to provide mapping between 2 ports
Systemport - any free port on the lab machine
Containerport : port on which container is exposed to. You can get this information from the Image, look for expose keyword on the image in docker hub


Method 1: user defined custom port mapping : 

 -p : this option will perform port mapping

$ docker run –name n2 -d -p Systemport:containerport  nginx

$ docker run –name n2 -d -p 8282:80 nginx
$ docker port n2


Method 2:  docker provided random port mapping : -P

$ docker run -d –name web -P httpd
$ docker port web

In this case user will not provide any port information

Docker will do random free port from host machine and map it to your container port

Access the container OR execute a command on the container from the host machine
=====================================================================
Take a container name which is running and which has port mapping done

$ docker exec -it containername command

$ docker exec -it web bash


Clean up docker host:
************************
Delete  all containers at once

$ docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
$ docker rm -f containername

Delete all images:

$ docker system prune –all

Delete all images
 Delete exited container
